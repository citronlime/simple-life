Test site working with responsive css
1. Working with flexbox and order for position html elements differently based on screen size
2. Line height standars, 1.6-1.7 is good for easier reding and nicer looking text
3. Setting max-width 100% on images to make them responsive
4. Setting max-height on image with in combination with object-fit: cover to crop an image to the defined height
5. Grouping style rules ie h1, h2, h3 {} when they share styles they should only be defined once
6. When working with links both a :hover and :focus should always be provided. The focus is used by peaple who use the tab to navigate 
7. Using text-transform: uppercase to have uppercase text. Always write the text in standard and the set uppercase in css
8. Working with rem for font-sizes and em for margins and paddings
9. When using em the em will be based on the parent font-size or the current set font-size for element
10. Using letter-spacing for easier to read when uppercase. A good standard is 1-2px
11. Using .widget-recent-post:last-child to change styles for the last chaild
12. For a container it is good practice to use width 90-95% to always have a small space on the sides when using small screens. Padding is an option to use
13. For a container always use max-width for responsive. Cannot grow larger but smaller.
14. For centering use margin: 0 auto
15. using an extra class for a container with flexbox to create a column for smaller screens, and the have a media query with the same class that sets a row layout for larger screens
16. Using aside element for a side column
17. Working with ul li a for navigation. And a .currenPage  class for creating a bottom border for current nav item
18. Working with media query to change direction of navigation on smaller screens to column
19. To change order of items in a container the container needs to have flexbox
20. Changing text style with strong
21. Using google fonts
22. Setting widths on flexbox elements in a row to not equal 100% ex 20%, 20%, 45% = 85% the rest 15% will be the space that is dividet between the elements if you want to use space-between. If the total is 100% the space-between will not work
